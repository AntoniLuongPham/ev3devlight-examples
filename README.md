# ev3devlight-examples
Examples for using [ev3devlight](https://github.com/laurensvalk/ev3devlight).

- Make sure you are running a [recent ev3dev stretch image](https://oss.jfrog.org/list/oss-snapshot-local/org/ev3dev/brickstrap/).
- To install the library, simply run
```
upip install ev3devlight
```
- Then run any of the examples above. (Use any method you like, but I recommend the [vscode IDE for EV3](https://github.com/ev3dev/vscode-ev3dev-browser).)
